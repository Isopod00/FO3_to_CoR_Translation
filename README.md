# FO3_to_CoR_Translation
The goal of this project is to translate First-Order 3-variable (FO3) predicate logic into the Calculus of Relations (CoR).

Contributors: Anthony Brogni, Sebastiaan Joosten

Our project currently supports:

-FO3 Expressions (including terms with repeated arguments, such as the predicate R(x, x))

-COR Expressions (both typed and untyped)

-Automated testing with the z3-solver Python library
